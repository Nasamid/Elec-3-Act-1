I designed a responsive navigation bar that would work efficiently on different devices. 
The base is of HTML with semantic structure, while the CSS adds some life to it through a centered, 800px maximum-width design 
with dark blue scheme for better readability and hover animation in both the nav bar and dropdown menu.

The JavaScript intelligently toggles the dropdown menu on mobile devices.
You will also note that on larger screens and smaller screens, it goes horizontal, 
complete with a dropdown on hover, while toggle click on smaller devices.
